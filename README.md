## Introduction
In the world of healthcare, the accuracy of diagnosis codes is paramount for patient cohort identification and data-driven decisions. Our project focuses on mapping a variety of diagnosis codes to simplify patient identification and streamline data analysis. Efficient disease code mapping is fundamental for advancing healthcare informatics, enabling comprehensive data analysis, and ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## Objectives
Our primary goal is to create an efficient mapping technique that bridges the gap between disease names and standardized codes, thereby streamlining processes within the realm of healthcare informatics.

## Methodology
### Mapping Process
Our approach involves the development of heuristics and guidelines for precise translations between different coding systems, such as SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM. The mapping process considers various relationships between concepts, including one-to-one and many-to-one mappings.

### Leveraging UMLS for Mapping
The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) plays a pivotal role in bridging concepts between ICD codes and SNOMED CT.

## Results
Our research has successfully mapped a significant percentage of diagnosis codes to their respective Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs), with only a small percentage of codes remaining unmapped.

### FuzzyWuzzy Algorithm
The utilization of the FuzzyWuzzy algorithm has enabled us to achieve highly accurate disease code mappings.

## Discussion
Our research underscores the importance of bridging the gap between ICD codes and SNOMED CT through the Concept Unique Identifier (CUI). This approach empowers data-driven healthcare informatics.
