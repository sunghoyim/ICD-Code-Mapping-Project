## Introduction

In the world of healthcare, accurate diagnosis codes are the cornerstone of patient cohort identification and data-driven decisions. Our project focuses on mapping a variety of diagnosis codes to simplify patient identification and streamline data analysis.

### Objectives

Our primary goal is to create an efficient mapping technique that bridges the gap between disease names and standardized codes, facilitating processes within the realm of healthcare informatics.

## Methodology

### Mapping Process

Our approach involves the development of heuristics and guidelines for precise translations between different coding systems, such as SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM. The mapping process takes into consideration different relationships between concepts, including one-to-one and many-to-one mappings.

### Leveraging UMLS for Mapping

The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) plays a pivotal role in bridging concepts between ICD codes and SNOMED CT.

## Results

Our research has successfully mapped a significant percentage of diagnosis codes to their respective Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs), with only a small percentage of codes remaining unmapped.

### FuzzyWuzzy Algorithm

The use of the FuzzyWuzzy algorithm has allowed us to achieve highly accurate disease code mappings.

## Discussion

Our research underscores the importance of bridging the gap between ICD codes and SNOMED CT through the Concept Unique Identifier (CUI). This approach empowers data-driven healthcare informatics.
