# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for the medical code translation project:

- **`icd10_cui_mapping.ipynb`** - Maps ICD-10 codes to CUI identifiers using UMLS API
- **`icd10cm_cui_mapping.ipynb`** - Processes ICD-10-CM codes for CUI mapping
- **`icd9_cui_mapping.ipynb`** - Handles ICD-9 code translations
- **`icd9cm_cui_mapping.ipynb`** - Maps ICD-9-CM codes to CUI system
- **`snomedct_cui_mapping.ipynb`** - SNOMED CT code processing and mapping

## Usage
These notebooks demonstrate the automated mapping process that achieved 98%+ success rates for medical code translation across multiple coding systems.
